# Machine Learning with Less Data using Few-Shot-Learning and Data Augmentation

This project is an endeavor to be able 
to have efficient and accurate Machine Learning models using fewer data samples. 

The model used here is the ResNet18 model which was built from scratch using TensorFlow's high level Keras API. 

The main method tested are Data Augmentation and Metric-based Few-Shot-Learning. 

The data used are the MNIST digit dataset along with handwritten digit picture we collected manually (~4000x3000). 

I personally contributed to this project as part of a group in the scope of the BLG454E Learning from Data course's final project.
